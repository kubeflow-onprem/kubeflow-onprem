## Overview

**Welcome!**

We are a community of Kubflow users and vendors serving as a community resource for on-premises installations of Kubeflow.



Per our SIG charter (see [kubeflow/community](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/sig-onprem/charter.md)):

>This SIG aims to develop best practices for Kubeflow deployments in on-prem environments.
>- Ensure that users have access to a list of validated reference designs for setting up a Kubeflow cluster.
>- Ensure that a process is defined that will enable users to contribute to reference designs.
>- Ensure that there is always at least one working and validated complete software stack. This software stack would be defined as a list of OSes and component versions that have been verified to create a working solution.
